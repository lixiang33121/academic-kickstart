  abstract = {{The efficient promoter of alcohol oxidase 1 (PAOX1) in methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is strictly induced by methanol but repressed by glycerol with an unclear molecular mechanism. In the present study, the gene of a previously characterized transmembrane protein glycerol transporter 1 (GT1) of P. pastoris GS115 was deleted by homologous recombination. Transcriptional profiles of the mutant (gt1Δ) and wild type (WT) were compared with different carbon sources (glycerol, methanol and glycerol-methanol mix) at various time points using high-throughput RNA-Seq techniques. We determined that the loss of glycerol transporter 1 (Gt1p) could relieve catabolite repression in the glycerol-methanol mixed medium and shared a similar transcriptional profile with the WT in methanol medium. By calculating the common differentially expressed genes in three distinct paired groups, genes involved in the stress response, nutrition deprivation and translational process were identified, explaining the potential roles of glycerol in the regulation of methanol metabolism. Based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis, the relationship between biological traits and the transcriptional profile was established. With the support of published research and our data, we propose two possible regulatory pathways that are involved in the regulation of catabolite repression (adenosine 5΄-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase /SNF1 and Mitogen-activated protein kinase/HOG), thereby providing potential targets for both research and industrial strain improvement.}},

  abstract = {{In methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris), the efficient promoter of alcohol oxidase (PAox1) is induced by methanol and repressed by glycerol, but the molecular mechanism is not clear. In this study, the relationship between alcohol oxidase 1 (aox1), methanol expression regulator 1 (mxr1) and glycerol transporter 1 (gt1) was studied. By RT-PCR, it was found that the overexpression of gt1 could increase the glycerol content in cells and repress the expression of mxr1 and aox1, and the deletion of gt1 reduced the glycerol content in cells and promoted the expression of aox1 .The overexpression of mxr1 could repress the expression of gt1, and the deletion of mxr1 could promote the expression of gt1 to some extent. By EMSA, Mxr1 binding sites were found in the promoter of gt1 (PGt1.) (-141 to -138, CCCC), and Mxr1 could regulate the expression of gt1 by binding to PGt1. The relationships among aox1, mxr1 and gt1 revealed here to provide a reference for the understanding of the mechanism of glycerol repression of PAox1.}},

  abstract = {{ABSTRACT Optimizing D-xylose consumption in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is essential for cost-efficient cellulosic bioethanol production. An evolutionary engineering approach was used to elevate D-xylose consumption in a xylose-fermenting S. cerevisiae strain carrying the D-xylose-specific N367I mutation in the endogenous chimeric Hxt36 hexose transporter. This strain carries a quadruple hexokinase deletion that prevents glucose utilization, and allows for selection of improved growth rates on D-xylose in the presence of high D-glucose concentrations. Evolutionary engineering resulted in D-glucose-insensitive growth and consumption of D-xylose, which could be attributed to glucose insensitive D-xylose uptake via a novel chimeric Hxt37 N367I transporter that emerged from a fusion of the HXT36 and HXT7 genes, and a down regulation of a set of Hxt transporters that mediate glucose sensitive xylose transport. RNA sequencing revealed the downregulation of HXT1 and HXT2 which, together with the deletion of HXT7, resulted in a 21\% reduction of the expression of all plasma membrane transporters genes. Morphological analysis showed an increased cell size and corresponding increased cell surface area of the evolved strain, which could be attributed to genome duplication. Mixed strain fermentation of the D-xylose-consuming strain DS71054-evo6 with the D-glucose consuming CEN.PK113–7D strain resulted in decreased residual sugar concentrations and improved ethanol production yields compared to a strain which sequentially consumes D-glucose and D-xylose.}},
